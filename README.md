# Home Searcher
Full stack coding challenge for Shogun.
> We’d like you to build a simple home address search that returns matching houses from a large set of houses – think Zillow but without the map. You will build the frontend that allows for user input to search and see results from that search. You will also build the backend which contains one endpoint that filters the homes from the search query and returns matching homes.
## Criteria
- Search returns homes related to address query (123 Fake St.) 
- HTML/CSS/JS web app frontend (React or similar frontend framework, basic design) 
- Backend with single endpoint (Rails, Node, etc) and ability to parse csv of homes (see 
below for getting csv of homes) 
- Readme with instructions on how to run the app 
- Basic styling and design 
## Outcome

The app is hosted [here.](https://warm-earth-32641.herokuapp.com/)
